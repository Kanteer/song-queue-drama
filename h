Hey, it's me, tripple/Kanteer.

Suprisingly, I'm still alive! It looks like people cared after all.

It took a lot of convincing to get people to believe that there was people that care for me. And now with the drama on the song queue about people talking shit about me, I need to clear a few things up so this drama can stop as soon as possible.

1. The "tripple deserves to die" message.
Ok, first of all, what the fuck? When has someone ever deserved to die over something on the internet? I'm fucking 14, and I already deserve the death sentence, according to this person. What they said was very stupid and immature. Grow up and get a real life, stop spreading drama.

2. The "I bet he raped his dog" drama.
No. Just no. What the fuck is wrong with you? Why would I ever rape a dog? Is it because I'm a furry? Listen, there's furries out there who will actually do that. I'm not one of them. Those people can have their own sick wet dreams about their dog, but not me. I would never use an animal for my own pleasure. It's just wrong.

3. The "good thing that tripple killed himself we dont need anymore bad mappers" message.
Ok. First of all, when has a god-tier mapper said my new maps are bad? Oh right, because there is no god-tier mapper. Everyone has there imperfections, and it's what makes us all beautiful. Also, where did you get the thing about killing myself? The message I wrote about "ending my life" was just me being a pissed off kid. I shouldn't have said it, yeah, but still. I didn't die. I didn't commit suicide. I'm fine.

Okay, I think that's all the drama for now that I just cleared up. If theres any more drama about me that I gotta clear up, just shoot me a dm. (KanteerCZ#1236)

Alright, that's all I wanted to say. Don't be jerks. Stay safe during this pandemic.

Sincerely, tripple/Kanteer.
